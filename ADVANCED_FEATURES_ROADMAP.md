## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

### DO's ✅
1. **Test after each phase** - Don't move forward if current phase breaks
2. **Keep existing features working** - Always test old functionality
3. **Use feature flags** - Enable/disable new features easily
4. **Backup database** before running new migrations
5. **Write unit tests** for new services
6. **Document API endpoints** as you create them
7. **Use Git branches** - One branch per phase
8. **Code reviews** - Review your own code before merging

### DON'Ts ❌
1. **Don't skip phases** - Follow the order
2. **Don't modify existing entities** without backup
3. **Don't delete old code** - Comment it out first
4. **Don't deploy to production** until fully tested
5. **Don't implement all at once** - You'll break everything
6. **Don't ignore errors** - Fix them immediately
7. **Don't forget to update documentation**
